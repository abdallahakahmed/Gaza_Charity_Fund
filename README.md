## Gaza Charity Fund Smart Contract
<p>This project is a Solidity-based smart contract for a crowdsourced charity fund. The contract enables users to donate Ether to a fund and restricts withdrawals to specific pre-approved addresses, based on defined conditions. The contract is designed for transparency, ease of access, and security, allowing for conditional withdrawal functionality.</p>

## Project Structure

* Donate.sol: The main contract file that defines the donation and withdrawal functionalities.
* DonorTest.sol: A testing file that uses Foundry to simulate donation and withdrawal scenarios.

## Features
* Donation Mechanism: Users can send Ether to the charity fund using the donate function, with a minimum donation amount requirement.
* Authorized Withdrawals: Only specific pre-approved addresses (e.g., the fund owner) can withdraw funds from the contract.
* Condition Verification: Withdrawals are permitted only when certain conditions are met (e.g., reaching a target donation amount).
* Error Handling: Custom error messages are thrown when users attempt unauthorized actions or transactions fail.
